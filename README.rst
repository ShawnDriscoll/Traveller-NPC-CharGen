Notes
-----

**Traveller NPC CharGen** is being developed using Python 3.11 and PyQt5.


Requirements
------------

* **Windows 11**

  It will also work with Windows 10.


Executing
---------

Run the .EXE for Windows 11 to start.

This program generates characters (using brute force) until a character is made that best matches the
chosen settings. It is possible to get stuck in an infinite loop if the chosen settings are unlikely
to generate a character. Simply use CTRL+C to exit out of the program.

During chargen, raw CSV and
JSON files are created in the data folder. The raw files can be used by CSV and JSON readers to mine
for data. The last character recorded in the raw files will be the one generated by the app.

Things To-Do
